# Scripts for Explainability Analysis

This repository contains scripts that implement Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) algorithms to generate 3D relevance maps.

## Available Scripts

- **Pyment**  
  Implemented in TensorFlow by its developer.

- **BrainAgeNeXt**  
  Implemented in PyTorch using the Zennit library.

## Additional Information

In the `LRP_Hammersmith.ipynb` notebook, the average 3D relevance maps are interpolated to the Hammersmith Atlas to obtain an average relevance score for each region of interest (ROI).
