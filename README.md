# 🧠 BRAIN AGE MODELS BENCHMARK
A comprehensive framework to benchmark, analyze, and develop brain age prediction models using neuroimaging data.

Overview
Brain Age Benchmark is an open-source repository dedicated to:

🧪 Evaluating the performance and bias of existing deep learning models for brain age prediction

🧠 Developing novel models to improve accuracy and generalization across datasets

📊 Comparing brain age prediction results across multiple cohorts

🌍 Exploring the impact of environmental and clinical stressors (e.g., long COVID, LMIC populations) on accelerated brain aging

We aim to provide transparent, reproducible tools and metrics for the neuroimaging community to better understand and extend brain age modeling.

Features
Modular pipelines for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

Pretrained models and scripts for benchmarking

So far we only use structural MRI but we aim to extend it to other modalities (e.g., ASL, PET)
